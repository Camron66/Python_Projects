# Python_Projects
These are all of the Python Projects that I've done

streamlit_app.py
 - This project was an app that displayed data, this was my first ever python project.

AirQualityApp.py
 - This project was my first ever project that connected to an API to display data.

Streamlit.py
 - This project displayed data coming from an NBA API, there were multiple pages that displayed data for NBA Teams
 - Looking back this code was written in a way that was inefficient and caused many api calls that were unecessary.

Student_Registration.py
 - This project was getting data from my SQL database that I created
 - The code within this project made automatic SQL Queries based on specific buttons that were being pressed within the tkinter GUI.
 - This allowed the user to use the GUI to manipulate the database in all 4 CRUD operations.

Tetris.py
 - This project is a tetris game that uses pygame
